# LSB-Steganography
My Project in C Language is to Encrypt and Decrypt a Secret Message File into a Bitmap Image File.

# What is Steganography?
Steganography is the art of hiding the fact that communication is taking place, by hiding information in other information. Many different carrier file formats can be used, but digital images are the most popular because of their frequency on the internet. For hiding secret information in images, there exists a large variety of steganography techniques some are more complex than others and all of them have respective strong and weak points.

Steganography is the practice of hiding private or sensitive information within something that appears to be nothing out to the usual. Steganography is often confused with cryptography, because the two are similar in the way that they both are used to protect important information. The difference between two is that steganography involves hiding information so it appears that no information is hidden at all. If a person or persons views the object that the information is hidden inside of he or she will have no idea that there is any hidden information, therefore the person will not attempt to decrypt the information.

# Requirements for Project
• The application accept an image file say .bmp along with the a text file which contains the message to be steged

• Analyze the size of the message file and the data part of the .bmp file to check whether the message could fit in the provided .bmp image

• Provide a option to steg a magic string which could be useful to identify whether the image is steged or not

• The application should provide a option to decrypt the file 

• This has to be an command line application and all the options has to be passed as an command line argument
